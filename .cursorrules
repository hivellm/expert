This project uses @hivellm/rulebook standards.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Always reference @AGENTS.md before coding
2. Write tests first (95%+ coverage required)
3. Run quality checks before committing:
   - Type check / Compiler check
   - Linter (no warnings allowed)
   - All tests (100% pass rate)
   - Coverage check
4. Update docs/ when implementing features
5. Follow strict documentation structure
6. **ALWAYS use PowerShell with cli/venv_windows virtual environment when executing Python commands that require GPU/CUDA** - WSL does not support CUDA, so PowerShell is required for GPU operations
7. **ALWAYS use PowerShell with cli/build-cuda.ps1 script when building the Rust CLI** - Use `.\cli\build-cuda.ps1` for building the expert-cli binary

Language-specific rules are in @AGENTS.md.
Module-specific patterns are in @AGENTS.md.

When in doubt, ask to review @AGENTS.md first.
